			<h3>All About Ru-Ping</h3>
			<p>Hey there! I'm 汝平 (Ru-Ping), a UX Writer looking to use my Human-Centered Design background to get into Content Strategy. <br/> <br/>

				This past summer, I did a Product Internship at Visualead, an IoT-company based in Shanghai that specializes in QR Code design. My UX Writing experiences with Visualead prompted a timely decision to focus my energies on pursuing a Content Strategy career. Thankfully, my background in journalistic and creative writing, along with HCD, have made the switch quite smooth. <br/> <br/>

				In terms of personal goals, I'm currently documenting my family history, as a means to understand and learn more about my cultural roots and background. Additionally, I hope to publish more creative writing pieces related to Overseas Chinese experiences, specifically American-born Chinese and Overseas Chinese in Korea experiences. 

				<p>Here are some other things I've done:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Majored in Statistics and received the Berkeley Certificate in Design Innovation</li>
				<li>Published a great number of <span class="first-load" style="color: #63b1ff; text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.dailycal.org/author/rupingchen/">creative writing pieces</a></span> for the Daily Californian</li>
				<li>Taught weekly sections for Mandarin language classes at the UC Berkeley EALC Department</li>
				<li>Infrequently update a blog <span class="first-load" style="color: #63b1ff; text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://mildlysatiricalconfessions.wordpress.com">here</a></span></li>
				<li>Translated Chinese idioms for <span href="https://www.tutorming.com">tutorming.com</span></li>
				<li>Won regional competitions in high school for news writing (2014 and 2015)</li>
				<li>...among other projects (work in progress)</li>

			</ul>
			<p>Feel free to contact me at <span style="color: #63b1ff;">rupingchn884@gmail.com</span>!</p>
