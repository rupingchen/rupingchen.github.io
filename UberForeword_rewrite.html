			<h2>Foreword</h2>
			<p>At the time of publishing this book, I recall many friends voicing contempt for Uber, mere minutes after whipping out their smartphones to get a ride. They usually say, "I don't Uber anymore." <br/>
				<br/>
			So when these friends see an Uber pick me up, they strongly suggest that I switch to another platform. <br/> <br/>
			Why? <br/> <br/>
			Well, I'm not interested in humoring misrepresentations of a company that I believe has dedicated itself to creating the future. Instead, let me tell you why I haven't given up on Uber. <br/> <br/>
			You see, I remember when the service first started in New York. At the time, Uber could hail only town cars, which usually didn't cost more than taxis, provided you had "a connection" or a contract with one of the town car services. 
			I stood on the sidewalk, in a part of the city where taxis were scarce, just as rain began to fall in New York City. I decided to try this new Uber thing and within a few minutes, a town car appeared. <br/> <br/>
			It felt like magic. <br/> <br/>
			And I would use Uber to go everywhere. Many years later, after I'd moved to Silicon Valley for work, I used Uber (instead of buying an actual car) to do two things: 1/ embrace my desire to live like a nomadic millennial (so I lived in Airbnbs, too) and 2/ evaluate the impact of the sharing economy by interviewing drivers of all socioeconomic backgrounds. <br/> <br/>Needless to say, my connection to Uber has been slightly different from that of those who've urged me to leave it. The biggest difference? Uber has taught me a lot about the future. <br/> <br/>
			And most importantly, Michael Gough's leadership on the design front with this impressive list of design principles (gathered by wonderfully diligent employees) sparks my interest in Uber's future. "77 Things" reminds me in structure of the late Marvin Minsky's "Society of Mind," in which Minsky designed the book so readers could turn to any of its thirty chapters and begin to read with little difficulty. The same can be said of 77 Things' design principles—there is no need to start from the beginning and trudge all the way to the end.<br/> <br/>
			For example, when I randomly turn the page to principle 75 ("We make to learn"), I am reminded of the values I hold most dearly with regard to things I've made: to learn from the act of making. That's what makes me the happiest and in the process, sometimes we learn more about ourselves and who we intend to serve. 
			These feelings naturally flow into principle 30, "Much of your success is determined by your context." What you make is primarily governed by the privileges you've accrued and the hardships you've endured, all of which influence the work you create. <br/> <br/>
			Needless to say, "77 Things" contains a wide spectrum of design teachings: we learn more about our customers in principle 75 while learning about ourselves and our limitations in principle 30. Both principles invite us to break free from biases that have held us captive and prevented us from creating with volition. <br/> <br/>
			Then we turn to principle 59, "Divergent thinking isn't as valuable as convergent thinking." This may give rise to a sense of confusion: "Wait a second. Principles 75 and 30 suggest that I break free, that I diverge, but principle 59 says the opposite!" Have no fear and don't find yourself surprised if a few—or even ten—principles contradict each other. <br/> <br/>
			Why? <br/> <br/>
			Uber embodies an extremely complex business, community, and a diverse range of products and services with time-varying behaviors. As a result, certain principles are applicable in certain situations, while others are not. And because we exist in states of flux, principles held dearly a week ago may not be the same you need today. And in a company like Uber, in which team and inter-team dynamics constantly change, having a set of diverse principles at our disposal encourages us to adapt to that change. <br/> <br/>
			So what does that say about the principles organized here in "77 Things?" Behold, random page-turn to principle 16 yields "Embrace diversity." Accept the fact that the world is more complex than you want it to be, and the best way to work within it is to meet its complexity head-on with the design principles here. And while my ten "Laws of Simplicity" may have been useful in a world that lacked smartphones, we now live in an infinitely more complex world. We must accommodate an endless amount of interaction patterns that exist in the modern age, and 77 feels like an appropriate place to start. <br/> <br/>
			Good luck, and I'll be thinking of all of you the next time I call an Uber (smile). <br/> <br/>
